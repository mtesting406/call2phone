Instructions for development & test

1. Install git with git bash (command line) - https://git-scm.com/downloads
Ensure that git bash here option is checked, to be able to start git bash
in a directory directly from the Windows explorer.

2. Install nodeJS and npm - https://nodejs.org/en/

3. Install http server from git bash command line as a global command:
npm install http-server -g

4. Download ngrok executable file - https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started
Doesn't install, just a portable exe file in the zip file.

5. Open git bash in the project library (TwilioToSpeech/simple-twilio-prototype/)

6. Start http-server in the project directory (same as index.html) using git bash:
http-server

or with another port if 8080 is already allocated by another application. With for example port 9090 instead:

http-server -p 9090

7. Run the previously downloaded (#4) ngrok.exe from the Windows command line in order to expose the local http-server on the Internet. Change the port below to the one your local web server is using.

ngrok.exe http 8080

Ngrok will start and show you the exposed URLs for HTTP, HTTPS etc.

8. Copy the ngrok Forwarding URL for HTTPS and open it in Chrome.
